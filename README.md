# Chronic-Disease-Indicators-Ongoing-

The goal of this project is to analyzie chronic disease indicators for the US population form years 2001 to 2016. 

According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the chronic disease indicators (CDI) are a set of surveillance indicators that nables public health professionals and policymakers to retrieve uniformly defined state and selected metropolitan-level data for chronic diseases and risk factors that have a substantial impact on public health. These indicators are essential for surveillance, prioritization, and evaluation of public health interventions.  

The chronic indicator data is distributed by the state and stratified by gender and ethnicity. 

Owing to the large size of the dataset, we are limiting our analysis for topics such as 'Cancer', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease' and 'Diabetes'.

We wil be answering the following questions:

1. We are going to try to find the correlation between the chronic disease using indicators such as alcohol use, smoking, high school completion, healthy eating habits, excercise, weight and mental health. For example, is there a correlation between tobacco use an lung cancer?                  
                  
2. We will try to dig into the data to find some race-related insights. Are people belonging to a certain race more hesitant to go for pap-smear (for cervical cancer) and a mammogram (for breast cancer)

3. We will find out which chronic diseases are more prevalent for each of the genders. Also, how do lifestyle and habits vary between the gender such as alcohol, tobacco use and excercise and if it effects the disease prevalence and mortality rate. 

Let's get started!
